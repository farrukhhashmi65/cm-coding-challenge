# Crewmeister Coding Challenger
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For the demo: http://146.190.204.211:8000/

Please follow the steps sequentially
1. Run the node express server
2. Run the react application

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run server`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

I have added few simple related APIs, we can also take use of those.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

1. This project is in Typescript, with proper use of esLint, 
2. For linting purpose I have also used the husky hook to stop the code push without linting.
2. I have used Material UI for the UI
3. I have used Material UI with Typescript and Styled component for minor user.
4. I have implement the custom theming with Material UI(providers)
5. I have added the translations with react-i18next
6. I have implement the Redux with Redux-saga middleware
7. I have used the sample test cases for component.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
